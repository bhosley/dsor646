# dsor646

In this repo are the functions that I used in DSOR646.

In general it follows OOP principles. It is intended to follow the logic
of implementing an MDP style model and implement an RL algorithm to train 
the resulting MDP modeled agent.

It was built during the course of the class, kludging the provided examples into one, so please excuse the obvious tech-debt and anti-patterns.
